   Are there any known issues?
</h2>
This bot is, of course, not perfect. Here is a list of issues I am currently aware of and will eventually fix (these aren't breaking issues):

- Bot dodges players that left the queue

   Where can I download it?
</h2>

Right now there is no release JAR file for you to download, this is because I'm still testing the modes I have currently implemented before making a beta release! If you still want to use it, you'll have to download this repo and compile it yourself.

<h2 align="center">
   How do I know if it's any good?
</h2>

Here's a demonstration video of the bot playing sumo: [Introducing Duck Dueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4939onPBd4Y).
Videos of the other modes will also be released at some point.
